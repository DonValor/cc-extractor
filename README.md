## FAQ
### Are there any differences between the ROMs in the collection and the Game Pak releases?
Each ROM contains at least two differences that I am aware of: References to Nintendo of America have been removed and the copyright year has been appended with "2002"

### Will this script work with the GOG.com release?
I do not own the GOG.com release, so I do not know if the offsets from the retail PC CD-ROM version are the same as their version. If they are, then this script SHOULD work
